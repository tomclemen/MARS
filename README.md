You can access the Kruger National Park base model (see Clemen et al., 2020 for more info) by:

Unzip the zip file to a location of your choice and open your terminal (linux, mac) or the command line (cmd). Navigate to the destination folder 'KNP Base Model' and follow the instructions below:

```shell script
KrugerNationalParkBox.exe

 ```shell script
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./KrugerNationalParkBox

As soon as the box starts, it shows you the current parameterization and stops the simulation. 

We added the description of the elephant agent in case you are interested to learn how it works.
More documentation will be added soon. Please contact us if you have questions or found a bug ;-)a
